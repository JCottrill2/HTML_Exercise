        Bio about myself: I am a stay at home mom, learning how to code. So far
        I really like learning the programs. My favorite part of C# has been
        learning loops and how the iterations work. Last night, I was able to
        walk my brother through how to do for, foreach, do, and do-while loops
        without having to look back in my lessons. I had a serious sense of
        pride doing that.

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I
        asked. "The <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly,
        "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted his hands and
        shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why would I want to
        win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
